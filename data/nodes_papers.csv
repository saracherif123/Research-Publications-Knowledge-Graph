Experiments were first carried out in a primary school with 66 fifth-grade students. Each participating student collaborated with other group members using SkyApp through a personal computer in a classroom setting. While the students collaboratively solved mathematics questions in two quizzes, data about their learning traits were captured by SkyApp; various patterns of these data were then analysed. The findings based on the data analysis were triangulated with the results of questionnaires, revealing the relationship between student behaviours and collaborative learning as a kind of pedagogical intervention. The correlation between the data from the two approaches – data analytics and questionnaires – shows the potential of understanding students’ behaviours through continuous data analysis of learner-produced data without the need to collect self-reported data from the students involved. This study demonstrates that teachers can monitor and identify the effects of specific pedagogical interventions on students’ behaviours by looking at different snapshots taken over the course of e-learning activities.",10.1080/10494820.2022.2039944

An aspect that can affect the learning process but is not taken into consideration by traditional ITS is the affective state of the learner. In this work, we propose the use of physiological signals and machine learning for the task of detecting a learner’s affective state during test taking. To this end, wearable physiological sensors were used to record electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) signals from 27 individuals while participating in a computerised English language test. Features extracted from the acquired signals were used in order to train machine learning models for the prediction of the self-reported difficulty level of the test’s questions, as well as for the prediction of whether the questions would be answered correctly. Supervised classification experiments showed that there is a relation between the acquired signals and the examined tasks, reaching a classification F1-score of 74.21% for the prediction of the self-reported question difficulty level, and a classification F1-score of 59.14% for predicting whether a question was answered correctly. The acquired results demonstrate the potential of the examined approach for enhancing ITS with information relating to the affective state of the learners.",10.1109/JSEN.2020.3023886

These systems may require the use of a huge number of MTC devices, which will put a great pressure on the whole network, i.e. Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN) parts, resulting in the shape of congestion and system overload. Aiming at better evaluating the network performance under the existence of MTC traffic and also the effectiveness of the congestion control methods, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) group has proposed two traffic models: Uniform Distribution (over 60 s) and Beta Distribution (over 10 s). In this paper, a recursive operation-based analytical model, namely General Recursive Estimation (GRE), for modeling the performance of RACH procedure in the existence of MTC with Beta traffic is proposed. In order to show the effectiveness of our analytical model GRE, many metrics have been considered, such as the total number of MTC devices in each Random Access (RA) slot, the number of success MTC devices in each RA slot, and the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of preamble transmission. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of GRE. Moreover, our model GRE could be used to model the performance of RACH procedure with any type of traffic.",10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417095

When these devices attempt to concurrently access the network, a radio access network overload problem arises. In this case, the conventional random access procedure used in Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) networks is rendered inefficient due to the frequent collisions that lead to excessive delay and resource wastage. In this paper, we propose an efficient scalable overload control algorithm for M2M with massive access. The proposed algorithm can allocate the uplink resources within bounded contention time in a distributed manner. Hence, it can achieve full resource utilization that leads to reduced: access delay, energy consumption, and blocking probability. Additionally, we provide a method for estimating the number of backlogged devices in the network. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated analytically and using simulations. To prove its effectiveness, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to the dynamic-access class-barring scheme, where the results depict the superiority of the proposed scheme. Finally, a binary integer programming problem is formulated, where we show that the achieved access delay using the proposed algorithm approaches the optimal value.",10.1109/JIOT.2018.2888502
93574827efa9dddf11d290cc55dbde6aea714453,A Simple Model of MTC in Smart Factories,2018,"In this paper we develop a simple, yet accurate, performance model to understand if and how evolutions of traditional cellular network protocols can be exploited to allow large numbers of devices to gain control of transmission resources in smart factory radio access networks. The model results shed light on the applicability of evolved access procedures and help understand how many devices can be served per base station. In addition, considering the simultaneous presence of different traffic classes, we investigate the effectiveness of prioritised access, exploiting access class barring techniques. Our model shows that, even with the sub-millisecond time slots foreseen in LTE Advanced Pro and 5G, a base station can accommodate at most few thousand devices to guarantee access latencies below 100 ms with high transmission success probabilities. This calls for a rethinking of wireless access strategies to avoid ultra-dense cell deployments within smart factory infrastructures.",10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8485942

Against this backdrop, cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) emerge as the times require. To achieve the parallel interactions between the human world and the computer network, IoT along with wireless mobile communication and computing open up some future opportunities as well as challenges for constructing a novel cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) that takes human factors into account during the system operation and management. In this article, a brief comprehensive survey is provided on some of the current research work that contributes to enabling CPSSs. Some crucial aspects of CPSSs are identified, including: the development from CPSs to CPSSs, architecture design, applications, standards, real-world case studies, enabling techniques and networks for CPSSs. To lay a foundation for the development of the upcoming smart world, we further propose a virtualization architecture and an integrated framework of caching, computing and networking for CPSSs. Simulations verify the performance improvement of the proposals.

A new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as responsible for the lung infection, called COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). An early diagnosis of those carrying the virus becomes crucial to contain the spread, morbidity and mortality of the pandemic. The definitive diagnosis is made through specific tests, among which imaging tests play a very important role. Achieving this goal cannot be separated from radiological examination, and chest X-ray is the most easily available and least expensive alternative. The use of X-ray chest radiographs, as an element that assists the diagnosis and that allows the follow up of the disease, is the subject of many publications that adopt machine learning approaches. This work focuses on the most adopted Convolutional Neural Network Techniques applied on chest X-ray images.",10.1109/BIBM52615.2021.9669784

Based on this study’s 746 lung CT images, we propose Multi-MedVit, a novel auxiliary COVID-19 diagnosis framework based on the multi-input Transformer. We compare Multi-MedVit with state-of-the-art deep learning methods, such as CNN, VGG16, and ResNet50. Multi-MedVit outperformed the other methods on the benchmark dataset and proved that multiscale data input for data augmentation helped enhance model stability. Based on an interpretable analysis of the input and output of Multi-MedVit, we found that with the support of the training set data, the model has been possible to accurately focus on the lesion area for diagnosis of COVID-19 without expert annotations, which can provide initial references containing more potential information to doctors more precisely and fleetly.",10.1109/BIBM55620.2022.9994860

000178cd12c8a6e5da8215b6365fae03c20fd18d,End-to-End Representation Learning for Correlation Filter Based Tracking,2017,"The Correlation Filter is an algorithm that trains a linear template to discriminate between images and their translations. It is well suited to object tracking because its formulation in the Fourier domain provides a fast solution, enabling the detector to be re-trained once per frame. Previous works that use the Correlation Filter, however, have adopted features that were either manually designed or trained for a different task. This work is the first to overcome this limitation by interpreting the Correlation Filter learner, which has a closed-form solution, as a differentiable layer in a deep neural network. This enables learning deep features that are tightly coupled to the Correlation Filter. Experiments illustrate that our method has the important practical benefit of allowing lightweight architectures to achieve state-of-the-art performance at high framerates.",10.1109/CVPR.2017.531
d534fc35fb46d0d1df38838db2107ebb0ec71ff4,EANTrack: An Efficient Attention Network for Visual Tracking,2024,"Recently, Siamese trackers have gained widespread attention in visual tracking due to their exceptional performance. However, many trackers still suffer from limitations in challenging scenarios, such as fast motion and scale variation, which hinder the full exploitation of target features. Consequently, the accuracy and efficiency of the trackers are limited. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient attention network, called EAN, to improve tracking performance. The EAN comprises three primary components, namely a Transformer-s subnetwork, a Transformer-t subnetwork, and a Feature-Fused Attention Module (FFAM). The designed Transformer-s and Transformer-t subnetworks adopt complementary structures and functions to fully integrate and emphasize the relevant feature information, including channel and spatial features. The FFAM is responsible for fusing the multi-level features from both subnetworks, which establishes the global dependencies between the templates and search regions and enhances the discriminative power of the model. To further improve the tracking accuracy, a novel Feature-Aware Attention Module (FAAM) is introduced into the tracking prediction head to enhance the feature representation capability of the model. Finally, we propose an efficient EANTrack tracker based on EAN for robust tracking in complex scenarios, which exhibits significant advantages in challenging attributes. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks indicate that our approach achieves remarkable tracking performance with a real-time running speed of 55.6fps. Note to Practitioners—Siamese trackers have garnered considerable attention in the field of visual tracking due to their impressive performance. However, these trackers often face limitations in challenging scenarios, which impede the complete exploitation of target features. As a result, the accuracy and efficiency of many trackers are compromised. To address these issues, we propose an efficient tracker called EANTrack to enable robust tracking in complex scenarios. Our EANTrack exhibits significant advantages in handling challenging attributes. Please refer to our complete paper for detailed information on the EANTrack tracker and experimental results. Practitioners in the field can benefit from our research by leveraging our findings and methodologies in their work. We encourage further exploration and experimentation to enhance the performance and applicability of visual tracking systems.",10.1109/TASE.2023.3319676
82f4f334e87737921035e7d172a895ed41a03fdf,The use of video clickstream data to predict university students’ test performance: A comprehensive educational data mining approach,2022,"Video clickstream behaviors such as pause, forward, and backward offer great potential for educational data mining and learning analytics since students exhibit a significant amount of these behaviors in online courses. The purpose of this study is to investigate the predictive relationship between video clickstream behaviors and students’ test performance with two consecutive experiments. The first experiment was performed as an exploratory study with 22 university students using a single test performance measure and basic statistical techniques. The second experiment was performed as a conclusive study with 16 students using repeated measures and comprehensive data mining techniques. The findings show that a positive correlation exists between the total number of clicks and students’ test performance. Those students who performed a high number of clicks, slow backward speed or doing backwards or pauses achieved better test performance than those who performed a lower number of clicks, or who used fast-backward or fast-forward. In addition, students’ test performance could be predicted using video clickstream data with a good level of accuracy (Root Mean Squared Error Percentage (%RMSE) ranged between 15 and 20). Furthermore, the mean of backward speed, number of pauses, and number/percentage of backwards were found to be the most important indicators in predicting students’ test performance. These findings may help educators or researchers identify students who are at risk of failure. Finally, the study provides design suggestions based on the findings for the preparation of video-based lectures.",10.1007/s10639-022-11403-y

However, few studies measure immersion while watching videos, and questionnaires are typically used in the measurement of immersion for other applications. These methods may rely on the viewer's memory and cause biased results. Therefore, we propose an objective immersion detection model by leveraging people's gaze behavior while watching videos. In a lab study with 30 participants, an in-depth analysis is carried out on a number of gaze features and machine learning (ML) models to identify the immersion state. Several gaze features are highly indicative of immersion and ML models with these features are able to detect an immersion state of video watchers. Post-hoc interviews demonstrate that our approach is applicable to measure immersion in the middle of watching a video, where some practical issues are discussed as well.",10.1109/TAFFC.2022.3209311

77cb4b76139c0e798b0e3fecc4f5db08f97aaf00,Behavior analysis of students in video classes,2020,"This Research-to-Practice full paper presents the result of a study whose core is characterized by the application of data analysis techniques from the use of video lessons. Distance education contributes to the generation of educational data to conduct investigations of educational processes. Methodologies for the automatic extraction of useful information from large volumes of data, especially data mining, have significantly contributed to improvements in the field of education. However, most traditional methods focus entirely on the data or how it is structured, with no significant concern with the educational process as a whole. Also, little attention has been given to information related to the students’ behavior during the use of educational resources and media. Therefore, we consider that examining the students’ behavior during the execution of educational videos can contribute to a more accurate analysis of the quality of the resources used, the way they learn, and what factors influence their learning. Thus, this research to practice full paper presents conducts a study to investigate how students behave during the use of video classes and seek to highlight the benefits of this type of analysis for education. Results demonstrate that evaluating the educational resource through the analysis of the actions involved can contribute substantially to the activities performed by teachers and content makers.",10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274274

Whereas previous studies typically present questionnaires at the end of the lecture, they fail to capture students' experience in enough granularity. In this paper we propose recording the lecture difficulty in real-time with a physical slider, enabling continuous and fine-grained analysis of the learning experience. We evaluated our approach in a study with 100 participants viewing two variants of two short lectures. We demonstrate that our approach helps us paint a more complete picture of the learning experience. Our analysis has design implications for instructors, providing them with a method that helps them compare their expectations with students' beliefs about the lectures and to better understand the specific effects of different instructional design decisions.",10.1145/3290605.3300816
